## Adding New Project Feedback

When starting feedback collection for a new project:

1. Create a new subdirectory: `feedback/project-name/`
2. Add evaluation and post-mortem documents as they're created
3. Update this README to document the new project

## Purpose

This feedback collection helps:

- Identify template bugs and improvement opportunities
- Track AI collaboration patterns and effectiveness
- Maintain institutional knowledge across projects
- Guide template evolution based on real usage data
