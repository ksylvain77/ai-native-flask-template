# AI-Native SDLC Template - Transformation Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

- **Status**: Flask-specific template with AI collaboration patterns
- **Value**: Contains proven SDLC automation and testing methodology
- **Challenge**: Framework-specific code limits reusability across tech stacks

## Vision: Framework/Language/Code Agnostic AI-Native SDLC

Transform this into a "Three Amigos + AI" SDLC orchestration system that works across any technology stack.

---

## Phase 1: Extract Core Framework ðŸ”§

**Goal**: Identify and preserve framework-neutral value

### 1.1 Component Audit

- [ ] **Keep**: Git workflow automation (create-branch, merge-to-main scripts)
- [ ] **Keep**: 4-phase testing methodology (concepts, not pytest specifics)
- [ ] **Keep**: Documentation patterns (ROADMAP.md, PROJECT_GOALS.md, BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md)
- [ ] **Keep**: Cross-platform script structure
- [ ] **Remove**: Flask-specific code and imports
- [ ] **Remove**: Python-specific testing frameworks
- [ ] **Abstract**: Environment setup patterns

### 1.2 Template Generation System

- [ ] Build framework selection mechanism
- [ ] Create language-specific script generators
- [ ] Design testing methodology adapters for different frameworks

---

## Phase 2: Generalize Automation ðŸ¤–

**Goal**: Make scripts work for any language/framework

### 2.1 Script Abstraction

- [ ] **Git workflows**: Already language-agnostic âœ…
- [ ] **Environment setup**: Create template system for different runtimes
- [ ] **Testing runners**: Abstract test command patterns
- [ ] **Dependency management**: Support npm/pip/cargo/composer patterns

### 2.2 Configuration System

- [ ] Create `project.config` for framework/language selection
- [ ] Template variable replacement system
- [ ] Environment-specific command mapping

---

## Phase 3: SDLC Orchestration ðŸŽ­

**Goal**: Implement "Three Amigos + AI" methodology

### 3.1 Discovery Phase Tools

- [ ] Requirements gathering templates
- [ ] Stakeholder interview automation
- [ ] User story generation patterns
- [ ] Acceptance criteria frameworks

### 3.2 Planning Phase Tools

- [ ] Work breakdown automation
- [ ] Sprint planning templates
- [ ] AI task estimation helpers
- [ ] Dependency mapping tools

### 3.3 Implementation Phase Tools

- [ ] AI pair programming workflows
- [ ] Code review automation
- [ ] Progress tracking systems
- [ ] Documentation generation

### 3.4 Validation Phase Tools

- [ ] Testing strategy templates
- [ ] Quality gate automation
- [ ] Deployment pipeline patterns
- [ ] Feedback collection systems

---

## Phase 4: AI Integration Patterns ðŸ§ 

**Goal**: Structured AI collaboration throughout SDLC

### 4.1 AI Workflow Patterns

- [ ] Context management systems
- [ ] Prompt template library
- [ ] AI decision logging
- [ ] Human handoff protocols

### 4.2 Knowledge Management

- [ ] Auto-updating documentation
- [ ] Decision tracking systems
- [ ] Learning loop implementation
- [ ] Best practice capture mechanisms

---

## Phase 5: Cross-Platform Distribution ðŸ“¦

**Goal**: Easy adoption across different environments

### 5.1 Installation System

- [ ] CLI installer for template
- [ ] Framework selection wizard
- [ ] Project initialization automation
- [ ] Dependency resolution

### 5.2 Documentation & Examples

- [ ] Framework-specific examples (Flask, FastAPI, Express.js, Spring Boot)
- [ ] Migration guides from existing projects
- [ ] Best practices documentation
- [ ] Video tutorials and demos

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Works with 3+ programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- [ ] Works with 3+ frameworks per language
- [ ] Complete SDLC automation (requirements â†’ deployment)
- [ ] AI collaboration patterns documented and reusable
- [ ] Community adoption and contributions

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. **Create TRANSFORMATION_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed audit of current components
2. **Proof of Concept** - Create one alternative framework example (FastAPI or Express.js)
3. **Abstract Git Workflows** - Ensure they work completely framework-agnostic
4. **Template System Design** - Plan the variable replacement and configuration system

---

## Key Principles

- **Incremental Transformation**: Use current Flask template as reference implementation
- **Preserve Working Value**: Don't break what already works well
- **AI-First Design**: Every component considers AI as a first-class team member
- **Cross-Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows support throughout
- **Documentation-Driven**: Clear context enables effective AI collaboration

_This roadmap transforms the current Flask-specific template into a universal AI-Native SDLC orchestration system while preserving the proven automation and collaboration patterns._
